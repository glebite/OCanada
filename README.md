O Canada!
=========
A simple wearable trinket that uses an Adafruit Lily to let the lyrics to
O Canada shine on this Canada Day coming up.

Thoughts:
---------
I had the Lily available, access to a 3d printer at the library, and a drive
to come up with something 'interesting'.  Initially it was just going to
alternate blinking white and red but then I thought about having it blink
the lyrics to O Canada (English and French) via Morse code.  The dot would
be red, and the dash, white.

Unfortunately the only LiPo battery that I had on-hand was a largish one but
I hope that it will be hidden enough in the darkness for people not to notice.

I know I cheapened out by only including lower case alphas and no accents
but frankly I don't care - it was an interesting little project.

Minor Impediments:
------------------
- access to the 3d printer is limited - when mine gets in, I'll produce a new one
- I had a design with holes to accommodate any cables as such but I brought the wrong file with me to the library (yes early commit to github would have prevented this stupid mistake)
- punctuation should be added later
